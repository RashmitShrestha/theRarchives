                Life is devoid of happiness. but it's supposed to be. <br><br>
                If joy was an innate part of life, everything would be dead. No reward to be received, the warm feeling would be a natural part of every
                living thing's system; there would be no motivation to be acheived what is already obtained. 
                <br><br>
                True joy comes from the birth of melancholy. If dopamine was constantly flooding our brain, never once leaving, the importance of value of the feeling
                of happiness is fictional.

                <h3>HYPNOS I</h3>
                <p>Dreams are an extension of our concious and emotional state that runs wild, especially during REM
                    sleep. It's all in the mind
                    therefore it's in your purview to control it. maybe not fully but regardless you do have a say in
                    what you want to see in your dreams and how u want to feel.
                    There are already techniques for lucid dreaming, so there's of course going to be ones for
                    controlling the subject of dreams.
                    <br /><br />
                    Whether you hate someone to death or love them to life, there's always some sort of emotional
                    conneection that you make with them. And depending on the intensity
                    of this connection, it might feel impossible for them to leave your thoughts. But in actuality, it's
                    all in your head :)
                    <br /><br />
                    However, if your connection with them is based on something unfinished, a negative problem that you
                    believe can be mended, then there are a few things you can do.
                <ol>
                    <li>Since dreams are based on reality (or at least the reality perceived by your own bodily senses)
                        there's something you have to change in that reality, which will
                        then in turn change the way you perceive the person(s)/situation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If changing reality doesn't work, change the filter you use to perceive these ideas. The things
                        you perceive using your senses
                        all end up to your brain to analyze and utilize. But before this, it passes through this filter
                        imposed directly by your thoughts.
                        For example, try perceiving every new or old piece of information as a lie; try to demonize
                        everything about that person; make
                        any thoughts of them unnatractive to you. Or if your problems lie in another direction, try to
                        justify their actions or pass them off as
                        not in control. You can ultimately apply this filter to anything that you perceive. But of
                        course, it's difficult.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Dreaming itself is based on REM sleep, so if you want to change the way you perceive dreams, you
                        have to change the sleep itself. Try making yourself more tired,
                        both mentally and physically. Solve a puzzle, learn new math, do push ups, meditate, etc. Don't
                        give your brain a chance to replay your subconcious while you're sleeping.
                        Rather, let it focus on regaining energy and processing newly perceived information (math
                        formulas, how to solve the puzzle, etc.)

                    </li>

                </ol>
                If there are people in your life who constantly show up in your dreams, then it could be
                because they play an important role in your life that you haven’t (yet) fully acknowledged.
                <br /><br />
                Make time for yourself to think about these people, and what they might represent to you — why do you
                think they’re showing up in your dreams all of a sudden?
                <br /><br />
                if the person you're dreaming about is based on love (friendship, romantic, sexual, etc.), then it's
                because of the deep feelings you have for them, even if you
                don't fully accept it or choose to believe it.
                <br /><br />
                This power is in your hands, even if it doesn't feel like it. You may not know what you want, and that's
                ok. However, the feeling that you get from
                this impurity, that is disconnected from not knowing what you want.

                <p>Purpose is more of a feeling than an actual thing. You can feel a sense of purpose without having a
                    goal you're intentionally trying to reach. Like,
                    chances are you felt like this as a little kid. You would go to school, listen to the teacher, do
                    your homework, and
                    play with friends without ever questioning why. You did those things simply because it seemed right
                    for you to do those
                    things. But were any of those things your life's purpose? Naw.
                    <br /><br />
                    So to me, chasing purpose is like chasing happiness. Happiness occurs when you're
                    too distracted by the goodness of life to spend a lot of time wondering how you can be happy.
                    A sense of purpose occurs when you're too busy being engrossed in stuff to spend a lot of time
                    wondering what your purpose is.
                    <br /><br />

                    How do you develop a sense of purpose? You gotta find activities, people, or places
                    that you love, where you feel like you belong. And if you don't love anything, you gotta figure out
                    why you're so depressed and try to address that.
                    <br /><br />
                    Why is a sense of purpose important? It is what keeps despair and hopelessness away.

                <p>Well, look at your life right now, without this drive of purpose. Do you like where you are at?
                    Doesn’t seem like it.
                    <br /><br />
                    Having a sense or purpose, your purpose, your drive to do things to do the best in whatever you’re
                    doing, isn’t that better
                    than just ‘living’ or going through the motions? Plus, you don’t need to do ‘big things’. They can
                    be small or manageable
                    tasks or things you want to do. You are right in terms of not wanting to work your life away. You
                    need a healthy balance
                    of life, work, family, friends, etc.
                    <br /><br />
                    For chasing your dreams, what was your first dream? Yes, some dreams are very unrealistic haha, but
                    dreams can be reality, if you try hard enough.
                    <br /><br />
                    I didn’t know what I was going to do in my life, and I told myself that I love working outdoors, so
                    I looked for
                    what jobs were outdoors and piqued my interest. That’s when I became a forester. I love my job and
                    have been living the
                    dream ever since.
                    <br /><br />
                    You need to find what interests you, what YOU want to do. Sometimes, it’s not all about making
                    money. You need to figure
                    this out yourself. No one else can tell you what to do here. You have to ask yourself who you are,
                    and what you truly want
                    to do with your life.
                    <br /><br />
                    Well, what do you want to do?!!

                    Everyone who laughs at you, berates you, spits on you, they've server their purpose. They've
                    provided you with enough ammunition to pump lead into everything
                    and everyone in your path. Use them to fuel your anger and then control your anger so that it works
                    for you. Never let it control you. Simply having anger and
                    using it to your advantage while your mind is clear are two different things, one is your mortal

                    <br /><br />
                    Sometimes you just need to shut them up. Use your actions instead of your words. Your words have no
                    substance when spoken with anger in mind. Instead, let their hate
                    and ignorance work for you. Show them what you can do. Show them why they should shut the fuck up.
                    Show them that you are a master of yourself and of the environment
                    around you. Actions speak louder than words.

                <p>Time is relative to the observer. When a person moving closer to the speed of
                    light time moves slower from them. Like an astronaut going to Alpha Proxima at near
                    light speed time moves about over four years. Time on Earth would have surged

                <p>
                    If you want to be truly happy, I think the obvious answer is to find and excel in the things you
                    love to do.
                    A lot of the time though, the things you think you want to do are influenced by social media, other
                    peoples
                    activities you see online, and a lot of the time, they are unrealistic ideals. Once I deleted
                    TikTok, Instagram,
                    and the rest of the lesser known unnecessary social medias, I started to form my own judgments of
                    activities better.
                    Sometimes I realized I was only doing a specific thing so I could make an Instagram post or update
                    my snap story.
                    <br /><br />

                    Additionally, I would advise not to be dependent on certain activities for your happiness. The world
                    is unpredictable,
                    and if something happens that prevents you from indulging in that activity, you'd basically be void
                    of happiness for
                    who knows how long.
                    <br /><br />

                    I feel like I'm lowkey talking out of my ass here, because as of right now I'm not necessarily
                    "happy," but I'm not really sad either...
                    Finding happiness isn't really an equation, but something that comes and goes in your journey of
                    life, along with other emotions like sadness, grief, all that...

                    Forgive but take measures - grudges have their uses like anger. Though self damaging they allow you
                    to take drastic measures against someone without hesitation or doubt.
                    <br /><br />
                    If you have a grudge it is important to either step out of it or utilize it to its full extent such
                    that you spend the least time in it.

                    All of us are haunted by our own storms. Sometimes the sound of thunder motivates us to be better, other times the hollow winds desecrate our will to survive,
