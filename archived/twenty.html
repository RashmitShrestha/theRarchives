                <h3>PANDEMIC I</h3>
                <p>I think I figured it out. 

                    Humans have desecrated the earth for their own gain, for many many years, harming all living organisms on the planet, including humans.
                     Just like the human body, all threats have to be removed in order for it to live. It’s called an immune system. 
                    <br><br>
                    And thus, the planet has it’s own immune system, and it has deemed mankind a threat. So it’s trying to exterminate us, this time through pathogenic warfare. 
                    <br><br>
                    It’s ironic, we’ve tortured and enslaved animals that we deem important for our nourishment, and this whole time they’ve been fighting back. 
                    But of course, we have as well. We create antibiotics and sprinkle them in their food, aiming to silence their cries for help through the spread of diseases. 
                    <br><br>
                    Of course these stress-caused diseases negatively affect these animals too. I see it as a dying will of revenge; they’ve suffered enough, so 
                    what of it if their executioners suffer too? 
                    <br><br>
                    But now it finally happened; those that hunted and sold bats in China were unaware of their aura revenge, in the form of an animal-to-human 
                    transmissible disease, starting the COVID 19 pandemic.
                    <br><br>
                    And now here we are. I write this at midnight of March. People say that everything will be back to normal in a month. But deep down I know, 
                    that this isn’t true. Wide spread ramifications will go on for years, many will die, many will suffer, and many will profit. 
                    <br><br>
                    This was caused by us, and now it’s up to us to alleviate the effects of this pandemic together, but I’m doubtful of human kindness.
