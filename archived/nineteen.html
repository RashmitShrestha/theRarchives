            <p>Purpose is more of a feeling than an actual thing. You can feel a sense of purpose without having a goal you're intentionally trying to reach. Like, 
                chances are you felt like this as a little kid. You would go to school, listen to the teacher, do your homework, and 
                play with friends without ever questioning why. You did those things simply because it seemed right for you to do those 
                things. But were any of those things your life's purpose? Naw.
                <br /><br />
                So to me, chasing purpose is like chasing happiness. Happiness occurs when you're 
                too distracted by the goodness of life to spend a lot of time wondering how you can be happy. 
                A sense of purpose occurs when you're too busy being engrossed in stuff to spend a lot of time wondering what your purpose is.
                <br /><br />

                How do you develop a sense of purpose? You gotta find activities, people, or places 
                that you love, where you feel like you belong. And if you don't love anything, you gotta figure out why you're so depressed and try to address that.
                <br /><br />
                Why is a sense of purpose important? It is what keeps despair and hopelessness away.</p>

                I mean that there are many moral systems but one can disagree with them with an appeal 
                to their own logic or moral inclinations (but also one's objections would be in reference 
                to their objective findings around them). Christian presuppositionalists will say humans have 
                no bases for their morals and logic without an external, omniscient reference but the problem 
                with that is the ideas God espouses are all attempting to appeal to human moral reasoning and logic ie. 
                if you obey god, you go to heaven which appeals to human desire, god is worthy of worship since he saved 
                the jews from egypt, the bible all follows human dialogue structures, etc. This means the bible is implicitly 
                validating human intellect and so is liable to criticisms based on human intellect. An alternative theory is 
                epistemic nihilism, human logic can't be justified. If that were the case however, in order to establish the 
                idea of nihilism itself  as a real idea and coherent one must appeal to human logic ie. knowledge exists outside an 
                individual's knowledge set is based on past human experience, the sentence itself implicitly validates human 
                sentence structure logic, etc. Therefore, the idea of nihilism is an attempt to use human logic to subvert human logic. 
                You run into the same inescapable tautology in the logical and moral question: correct logic is correct because 
                it simply is by necessity, and our moral inclinations, if satisfying humans in a way that allows everyone to keep playing 
                the game of life unhindered as possible, are correct by necessity.
