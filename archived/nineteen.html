                This world is a joke<br />
                There's no hope left to fix it<br />
                Can't wait till it ends<br />
                So vindictive and sickening<br />
                Evil and misery<br />
                That's a familiar<br />
                Topic of history<br />
                Killers every corner<br />
                Call the coroner<br />
                Everywhere you look<br />
                Another fucking mourner<br />
                Searching for justice<br />
                They won't get it<br />
                Everything's fucked in<br />
                This world we live in<br />

                [Outro]<br />
                Tell me are you feeling better now<br />
                As you watch your worthless life<br />
                Crumble to the ground<br />

                ‘Shooter’ is about the increasing amount of school shootings taking place around the world. Jake raps from the perspective of a condescending 
                external force, telling this story about a shooter from a biased position. Jake clearly shows hatred for the school shooter; 
                calling him “frail” and a “fucking coward”.

                I mean that there are many moral systems but one can disagree with them with an appeal 
                to their own logic or moral inclinations (but also one's objections would be in reference 
                to their objective findings around them). Christian presuppositionalists will say humans have 
                no bases for their morals and logic without an external, omniscient reference but the problem 
                with that is the ideas God espouses are all attempting to appeal to human moral reasoning and logic ie. 
                if you obey god, you go to heaven which appeals to human desire, god is worthy of worship since he saved 
                the jews from egypt, the bible all follows human dialogue structures, etc. This means the bible is implicitly 
                validating human intellect and so is liable to criticisms based on human intellect. An alternative theory is 
                epistemic nihilism, human logic can't be justified. If that were the case however, in order to establish the 
                idea of nihilism itself  as a real idea and coherent one must appeal to human logic ie. knowledge exists outside an 
                individual's knowledge set is based on past human experience, the sentence itself implicitly validates human 
                sentence structure logic, etc. Therefore, the idea of nihilism is an attempt to use human logic to subvert human logic. 
                You run into the same inescapable tautology in the logical and moral question: correct logic is correct because 
                it simply is by necessity, and our moral inclinations, if satisfying humans in a way that allows everyone to keep playing 
                the game of life unhindered as possible, are correct by necessity.
